## Brain Dynamics Toolbox
**Version 2023a** is the latest release. It works with **MATLAB R2020a** or newer, but we recommend **MATLAB R2023b** or newer for its improved DDE solver. Installation is as simple an unzipping the source code and adding its location to the matlab search path. See the Handbook for details. If you use the toolbox then please cite it.

## Handbook & Online Courses
The [handbook](https://github.com/bdtoolbox-org/bdtoolbox/releases/download/2023a/HandbookSample2023.pdf) is the official guide to the Brain Dynamics Toolbox. It can be purchased from most online bookstores. Online training courses are also available. [Toolbox Basics](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/toolbox-basics) is a beginner-level course that guides new users through the installation process and running the example models. The [Modeller's Workshop](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/modellers-workshop) is an intermediate-level course for those that wish to program their own models. The courses are hosted by Teachable.

## Models
The toolbox ships with 60 example models. Users can also share their models with the [Brain Dynamics Toolbox Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/bdtoolbox) hosted by Zenodo.
