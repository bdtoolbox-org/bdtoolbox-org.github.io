## **Brain Dynamics Toolbox**
**Version 2022a** is the latest release. It includes new display panels for computing the Jacobian of an ODE and its eigenvalues. Plus many example models from Steven H. Strogatz's textbook on Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.

## **Installation Requirements**
 A basic instalation of **MATLAB R2020a** or newer is required. Octave is not supported. 

## **Official Handbook**
The [Handbook for the Brain Dynamics Toolbox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0645066915) is the official software manual.
It can be purchased online from most bookstores.
[Chapter 1](https://github.com/bdtoolbox-org/bdtoolbox/releases/download/2022a/HandbookSample2022.pdf) can be downloaded for free.

## **Online Courses**

**[Toolbox Basics](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/toolbox-basics)** is a beginner-level course that guides new users through the installation process and running the example models. Study time is 2 hours.

**[Modeller's Workshop](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/modellers-workshop)** is an intermediate-level course for those that wish to program their own models. Study time is 8 hours. 


## **Example Models**

The toolbox ships with 60 examples of ODEs, DDEs, SDEs and PDEs. Some of these models are featured in our online [Gallery](../gallery). See Table 1.1 of the Handbook for the full list.
