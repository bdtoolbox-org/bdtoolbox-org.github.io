## **Installation Requirements**

The latest version (2021a) of the Brain Dynamics Toolbox requires **MATLAB R2020a** or newer. No specific MATLAB toolboxes are needed.

## **Official Handbook**
The [Handbook for the Brain Dynamics Toolbox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0645066915) (Heitmann &amp; Breakspear) is the official software manual.
It can be purchased online from most bookstores.
[Chapter 1](https://github.com/bdtoolbox-org/bdtoolbox/releases/download/2021a/HandbookSample2021.pdf) can be downloaded for free. It describes the installation process and getting started.

## **Online Courses**

Self-paced online training courses are provided via the [Teachable.com](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com) platform:

**[Toolbox Basics](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/toolbox-basics)** is a beginner-level course that guides you through the installation of the software and running your first model. Study time is 2 hours.

**[Modeller's Workshop](https://bdtoolbox.teachable.com/p/modellers-workshop)** is an intermediate-level course for those that wish to program their own models. Study time is 8 hours. 

## **Example Models**

The toolbox ships with many examples of ODEs, DDEs, SDEs and PDEs. Some are featured in our [Gallery](../Gallery). See Table 1.1 of the Handbook for the full list.
